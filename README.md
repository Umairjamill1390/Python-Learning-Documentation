### Comments in Python
Comments are text notes added to the program to provide explanatory information about the source code. Python ignores comments and understands that its used to explain the code to future programmers. 

` # is the representation for a comment in python.`

## Data Types
- `int` stores numeric data
- `float` stores decinal values
- `str` stores alphabetic data / strings
- `bool` stores either True or False

Here is a small pyhton code representation for data types

```
any_number = 123          # int
any_decimal = 123.456     # float
any_name = "Andrew"       # str
any_decision = True       # bool
```
